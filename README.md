Hi, I'm Ethan Daniel, but my friends usually call me Dandi, you can call me whatever you like. I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development at UNESC. I have a thing for front-end but I'm very interested in learning new things.

In my free time I like to play the guitar, read, play games, listen to music or just listen to the silence. I love rainy days and my most productive time is at night. I also like to take a few minutes out of my day to explore what's new in the world of technology.
## 🌎 What languages do you speak?

Portuguese is my first language. I speak intermediate level English and I want to learn Italian and Japanese in the near future.
